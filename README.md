# The Bridge and Lantern Riddle

This project focuses on developing a **Variational Quantum Circuit** capable of performing **Binary Classification** between two classes: **red wine** and **white wine**, based on their characteristics using machine learning. Our system consists of both quantum and classical components.  

- **Quantum Component (Quantum Circuit):**  
  A block responsible for encoding/embedding, a block responsible for the variational algorithm, and measurement blocks.  

- **Classical Component:**  
  Post-processing (associating measurements with labels), loss function computation, and optimization of variational parameters (Î¸). In some cases, special classical preprocessing may also be necessary, such as dimensionality reduction of the dataset using PCA techniques.  

**Python Stack:**  qiskit, json, numpy, pandas, sklearn, itertools, matplotlib, qiskit_machine_learning, sys
